## Creating Your Own Sound

If you want to create a custom sound:

1. Use **Audacity** (free audio editor)
2. Record or generate a simple tone
3. Add reverb for depth
4. Keep it under 1 second
5. Export as MP3 (128kbps is fine)
6. Test volume - should be subtle

## Alternative: Silent Mode

If you can't find a suitable sound, the game will work without it. The visual sparkle effect alone provides feedback.

To disable sound:
- Simply don't add the `place.mp3` file
- The game will gracefully handle the missing audio

## Testing Your Sound

1. Place `place.mp3` in this `sounds` folder
2. Open the game in a browser
3. Complete a puzzle piece placement
4. Adjust volume if needed (edit in audio software)
