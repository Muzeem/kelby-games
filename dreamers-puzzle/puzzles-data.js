        revelation: 'Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity (1905)',
        explanation: 'Albert Einstein, a patent clerk with no academic position, rewrote the laws of physics. His theory of relativity revealed that space and time are woven together, that mass bends the fabric of spacetime, and that E=mc². This quiet revolution in thought gave us GPS satellites, nuclear energy, and our understanding of black holes. Einstein proved that one mind, thinking deeply in solitude, could reshape humanity\'s entire understanding of the universe.'

As the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (and the only person to win in two different sciences), she shattered gender barriers in science. Her relentless curiosity in a male-dominated field proved that genius knows no gender, and her discoveries continue saving lives today.'
